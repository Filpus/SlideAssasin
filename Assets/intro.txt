Evil mage’s castle... It used to be my father’s castle.
Before that traitor poisoned our guards, killed my mother and brothers in their sleep, and finally thrust a dagger through my father’s heart.
I wasn't in my chamber that night — I don't even remember exactly why. Some stupid, childish tantrum made me run into the woods, where I got lost.
I couldn't find my way back — but neither could they find me.

When I finally returned to the city in the morning, all I heard was mourning.
The coup went unpunished. People were too terrified of the evil forces backing the traitorous mage to protest.
Soldiers either pledged loyalty to the new king or were executed.

The traitor ruled freely for almost ten years.
But he won't do so anymore.

Tonight is the night.
I will get my revenge — no matter what it takes, even if he kills me too.

The traitor is a dead man walking.
