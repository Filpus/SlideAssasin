"Evil mage’s castle... It used to be my father’s castle.\r\nBefore that traitor poisoned our guards, killed my mother and brothers in their sleep, and finally thrust a dagger through my father’s heart.",
"I wasn't in my chamber that night — I don't even remember exactly why. Some stupid, childish tantrum made me run into the woods, where I got lost.\r\nI couldn't find my way back — but neither could they find me.",

"The traitor is a dead man walking."
